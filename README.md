# Legend of Zelda Online

The goal of this project is to recreate the original NES Legend of Zelda in C# and
[MonoGame](https://www.monogame.net/) and to make the game playable online as an online co-op
adventure game for up to 4 players.

**Current Status (April 4, 2020):** Link is able to walk around and to walk between rooms. Link's
attack animation is done. Basic collision detection (i.e. Link colliding with immovable rocks) is
done.
